## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within Plotter, please send an email to [prillerpatrick@gmail.com] with all the details you have about the issue. Your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings are sincerely appreciated and will be taken into account to improve the security of the project.

Please do not disclose publicly any security issues until we have had a chance to investigate it and provide a fix.

## Security Measures

Given the current stage of the project, extensive security measures have not been implemented yet. However, we are committed to ensuring the safety and integrity of the project and will take necessary actions as the project evolves.

Please note that while we strive to respond to all valid security issues, the response may vary depending on the details of the vulnerabilities.
